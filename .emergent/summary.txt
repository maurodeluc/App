The AI engineer successfully converted the LEAF web app to a React Native/Expo mobile application. The process involved initial setup, backend integration (FastAPI/MongoDB), and incremental frontend development (Homepage, Calendar, Insights, Profile, Bottom Navigation). Challenges included resolving library conflicts (, ), managing image assets (base64 logo issues), and iterative UI/UX refinement based on user feedback. The engineer meticulously addressed design inconsistencies, header preferences, chart display issues, and dynamic content (daily tips). The latest work focuses on customizing the profile page with a user-provided photo and updated professional title. The development has been iterative, with frequent testing and direct user collaboration to achieve the desired look and functionality.

<product_requirements>
The user, Dr. Mauro De Luca, required converting their existing React web app, LEAF (Laboratorio di Educazione Alla Felicit√†), into a native mobile application for the iOS App Store using React Native/Expo. The original app is a therapeutic mood tracking tool with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB database, featuring a mobile-first design and Italian interface.

Key components to convert/implement:
1.  **Homepage**: Mood selector, activity tracking.
2.  **Calendar View**: Display entries.
3.  **Insights Tab**: Interactive graph (originally Recharts, needed mobile-compatible library).
4.  **Profile**: Dr. De Luca's information, CSV export functionality.
5.  **Bottom Navigation**: Four main tabs.

The conversion must retain:
*   Original design and UI/UX (this was a significant iterative point).
*   Existing business logic.
*   Integration with the existing FastAPI + MongoDB backend.
*   Mobile-compatible mood graph.
*   CSV export functionality.
*   Optimized mobile navigation.

Throughout the project, user feedback led to refinements in the app's visual style, including specific logo integration, gradient colors, layout changes (welcome cards, button styles), improved chart rendering, a simplified header, automatic links for contact information, and a daily rotating mental wellness tip system. The goal is a publishable, professional, and user-friendly iOS app.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React Native/Expo**: Primary framework for mobile app development.
-   **Expo Router**: Used for file-based navigation.
-   **FastAPI**: Existing backend for API services.
-   **MongoDB**: Database for data storage.
-   ****: Chosen for interactive data visualization.
-   **Base64 Encoding**: For image handling (logo, profile photo).
-   ****: For UI gradients.
-   ****: For automatic contact links (email, phone, web).
-   **State Management**: Implicitly handled for UI states, though explicit libraries like Zustand weren't specifically mentioned as implemented.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture: a React Native/Expo frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



**Key Files and their Importance:**

-   ****: This file contains the FastAPI backend logic.
    -   **Summary**: It manages API endpoints for mood tracking, activity logging, fetching entries for calendar and insights, and export functionality. It interacts with the MongoDB database.
    -   **Changes**: Initial extension to support mood tracking, entries, and export features as part of the conversion plan.

-   ****: Expo configuration file.
    -   **Summary**: Defines app-level settings like name, icon, splash screen, and environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Configured for the LEAF app, likely setting up the app name and other Expo-specific properties.

-   ****: The main entry point and initial screen for the Expo Router.
    -   **Summary**: Serves as the base layout, often including the bottom navigation and routing logic.
    -   **Changes**: Initially set up with a beautiful introductory homepage, then iteratively modified to integrate the LEAF logo, various header designs, welcome cards, and the daily tips feature.

-   ****: The primary home screen of the application.
    -   **Summary**: This screen hosts the mood selector, activity tracking, and potentially the daily wellness tips.
    -   **Changes**: Created to handle homepage-specific UI and logic, including displaying the daily rotating wellness tip, the mood selection, and general layout. It was heavily modified during design iterations to match user-defined aesthetics, including header and card styling.

-   ****: Screen dedicated to data visualization.
    -   **Summary**: Displays interactive charts (e.g., mood distribution, activity frequency, temporal trend) using , along with statistics and period selectors.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented with , refined to display emoji-based Y-axis, period selector functionality, and to ensure chart elements (like the x-axis line) remained within their bounds, preventing text overlap.

-   ****: The user profile screen.
    -   **Summary**: Contains information about Dr. De Luca, contact details, and the CSV export functionality.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup included Dr. De Luca's info and export. Later, it was updated to replace a generic logo with a user-provided photo, update the professional title, and implement automatic linking for email, phone, and website. It also had fixes related to  imports.

<pending_tasks>
-   The last step taken was converting the user's photo to base64 for the profile page. The actual update of the  file to display this photo and change the psicologo clinico text to psicologo psicoterapeuta is pending.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of updating the **Profile** page (). The user explicitly requested to:
1.  Replace the existing logo/placeholder with a newly provided photo (an artifact uploaded by the user).
2.  Insert this photo into the circular display area on the profile page.
3.  Change the text psicologo clinico to psicologo psicoterapeuta.

So far, the AI has successfully retrieved the user's uploaded photo () and converted it into a base64 data URI (). The next immediate action is to apply these changes to the  file. The previous AI engineer stated, Perfetto! Ora ho la tua foto convertita in base64. Aggiorno la pagina profilo con la tua foto nel cerchio e la dicitura corretta.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Update  to display the user's base64 photo in the circular space and change the text from psicologo clinico to psicologo psicoterapeuta.
